This is my project on Sentiment Analysis using NLP.
The system can analyze text (like reviews, comments, or tweets) and classify the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

🚀 What it Does-------------------

Cleans and preprocesses text (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.)

Uses NLP techniques like tokenization and TF-IDF for feature extraction

Applies Machine Learning models to predict sentiment

Gives output with sentiment label and accuracy
